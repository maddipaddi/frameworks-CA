# ClicketyCart - JS Frameworks CA

## About the Project

At **ClicketyCart**, we believe shopping should be as quick and seamless as a single click. No delays, no hassleâ€”just instant access to the products you love. With a sleek, turbo-charged checkout process and lightning-fast delivery, we take online shopping to the next level. Whether you're browsing on the go or making last-minute buys, ClicketyCart gets it done faster than you can say "add to cart." ðŸ›’ðŸ’¨

This project is the **frontend implementation** of a fictional e-commerce store, built on an existing backend API provided by Noroff. The aim is to bring the user interface to life with a fun, retro design and modern React functionality.

## Features

- The Homepage has a list of all the products. There is a look-ahead search bar that filters products when typing in a product name. Clicking on a product takes a user to an individual product page.
- The pages use a <Layout> component that contains a header and footer. The header contains a nav bar as well as a Cart icon component that acts as a button as well as displays the current number of items in the cart.
- The individual product page displays data for a single product. There is an Add to cart button which, upon clicking, adds the product to the cart.
- Clicking on the Cart icon will load the Cart page, which will list all of the products as well as a total. The Cart page has a Checkout button. Clicking this Checkout button then goes to a Checkout success page.
- The Checkout success page displays a message to the user notifying them that their order was successful.
- There is a contact page which contains a contact form.
- React Router is used to switch between pages.
